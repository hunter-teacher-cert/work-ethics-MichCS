# Facial Recognition 
 **Participants:** Lyuba Fridman and Michelle Best

**Issue:**
Moving forward in an ethical manner with Facial Recognition technology.

**Program:**
Call an API from a Java program that performs facial recognition. Hopefully we can find a free API that does this from the list provided here: https://recfaces.com/articles/face-recognition-apis . We will use the API to collect results and then analyze them.

**Idea for Colleague Implementation:** 

1. Show ethical code
2. Create an interactive presentation lesson that teachers can incorporate into their CS unit. *The purpose of this lesson is to bring awareness and enlighten.*
